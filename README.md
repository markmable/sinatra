Trial
=============


Provision a new application server and deploy the following application
-------
A development team wants you to deploy this simple web app. 
- Come up with a way to deploy this app and write configuration-as-code to deploy it.
- We are primarily using Terraform/Salt but feel free to use any Configuration Management tool (Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Salt) and/or Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, Cloudformation, Pulumi) as you so choose.
- Main requirement is to deploy this to AWS. You can create a free-tier AWS account.
- Ensure that the instance is locked down and secure 
- Suggest ways to do ongoing deployments on this application
- Bonus points if you are able to containerize this environment and deploy it to a AWS Container Orchestration Service (ECS/EKS)
- Additional bonus points if you are able to use a CI/CD tool (Gitlab/CircleCI/TravisCI/CodeDeploy) to deploy this


Expected output
-------------
- A method of being able to do repeatable deployments of the simple web application
- Within a readme or similar, articulate the reasons for the decisions you made 
- Share this output with the hiring manager - via a link to a git project, text file, or artifact
